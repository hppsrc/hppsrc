(plus relative timestamps) </li> <br> <li> JSON render content HTML Render (Not a feature, more like, it is what should happen) </li> <br><br> I will add a banner image for each post and at the same time do it Open Source, but right now I make a VS code extension :) <br><br> <b> Thank you for reading! </b> ",
